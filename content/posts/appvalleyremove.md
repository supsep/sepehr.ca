For users who downloaded AppValley's un-revokable Configuration Profile, and are concerned about their privacy - this is how to remove it.

Download and install the following profile: **![appvalley.mobileconfig](appvalley.mobileconfig)**

Once installed you, go to the following in settings **General** -> **Device Management** -> **appvalley**

Then press **Remove Profile.**

There will be a follow-up post on the mechanism behind this.
